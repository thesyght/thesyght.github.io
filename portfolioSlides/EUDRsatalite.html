                The KPMG Origins platform, designed for supply chain traceability, was focussed to tackle the immediate issue of the EUs incoming Deforestation Regulation. To enable importers of agirculture commodities into the EU to prove the source of origin down to the individual grain of rice.
                Ontop of proof of Origin, importers will be required to provide proof of an absence of deforestation, modern slavery and other strict regulatory requirements.
                Due to the scope of required data, manual validation, an expensive endevour, would be significantly supplmented with automated data collation and validation. Machine learning techniques in tandem with a more extensive use of GIS software was used to create realtime masks of deforestation on the farms against baseline's relevant to the EUDR requirements.
                Deforestation events attached to farm could then be traced down the supply chain, and private organisations and governemnt regualtors alike could visualise real-time compliance alerts and make cost-effective actions to remedy.
                This project was a great example of some of the opportunties for novel research I got to conduct during this time, academic rigor was applied to the model that was produced.
