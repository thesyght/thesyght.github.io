                A nationally consistent system to enable waste operators to track and report on the movement of hazardous and regulated waste. 
                NSW EPA (in collaboration with QLD DES) engaged KPMG Origins to design, build and operate this solution atop their established trackability platform.
                A core component of this work was to streamline and improve reporting of data for the regulators in the sytem, providing detailed dashboarding and analytics to enable regualtors to easily identify irregular behaviour in their jurisdiction.
                These capabilities included descriptive dashboarding, summarisation and metric delivery. However, also covered was discrepency reporting, and demonstration of demand forecasting and anomaly detection. This reporting was delivered as real-time dashboards available to regulators and operators in the industry. 
                Ontop of this, my team lead several associated projects to research and identify errornous behaviour in sections of the resource recovery market, delivering these reports to decision makers in the state and federeral agencies.
