            <div class="slide-layout-description">
                A market-led, digital product deployed in NSW Australia to enable the differentiation of construction assets (e.g. Residential Apartment Blocks) based on a quantitative assessment of the trustworthiness of the construction of those assets. 
                The project was lead by the NSW Governmentâ€™s Dept. of Customer Service to restore consumer confidence in the NSW construction sector. 
                This assessment took into consideration  WHO the participants were in the construction, WHAT materials were used and HOW the construction had been certified throughout and the end of construction.
                The heart of this product was a model developed by myself, with input from actuaries within KPMG Australia, academics from Western Sydney University and wider Industry Experts.
