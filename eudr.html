    <p>The European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) is scheduled to commence on 30 December 2024.</p>
    <p>Under the EUDR, certain products for export to the European Union (EU) will have to meet new rules relating to the
        land on which they were produced. Exporters will need to ensure the land has not been subject to deforestation or
        forest degradation since 31 December 2020. They will need to provide clear evidence to EU operators and EU traders
        to support this.</p>
    <h2>Commodities</h2>
    <p>Commodities targeted by the EUDR are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cattle (including beef)</li>
        <li>Cocoa</li>
        <li>Wood</li>
        <li>Coffee</li>
        <li>Oil Palm</li>
        <li>Rubber</li>
        <li>Soya</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It also extends to a range of relevant products derived from these commodities, such as leather, chocolate and paper.
    </p>
    <p>See the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32023R1115" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener" class="external-link external-link-end"><span>full list of relevant commodities and products
                (Annex 1 of the EUDR</span></a>).</p>
    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>To export to the EU, you will need to meet the requirements of the EUDR.</p>
    <p>You will be required to provide details of the product, including geocoordinates of all product locations until it
        was processed (for cattle, this is from birth to slaughter). You must also provide proof that production of your
        consignments followed all Australian laws, and that production is not associated with deforestation or (for wood)
        forest degradation.</p>
    <h3>Information Requirements</h3>
    <p>EU importers (termed 'Operators') and EU Traders will have to provide details of the product and supply chain to the
        EU authorities. They will use this to ensure the products meet the requirements of the EUDR.</p>
    <p>EU authorities will require the following information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a description, including the trade name and type of relevant products</li>
        <li>for wood products, the common name of the species and its full scientific name</li>
        <li>a list of relevant commodities or products contained in, or used to make, the products</li>
        <li>product quantity (expressed in net mass, volume, or number of units)</li>
        <li>identification of the country of production</li>
        <li>geolocation of all plots of land producing commodities containing relevant products&nbsp;</li>
        <li>the geolocation of the establishments that kept cattle</li>
        <li>date or time range of production</li>
        <li>evidence that the commodities were legally produced</li>
        <li>adequately conclusive and verifiable information that the relevant products are deforestation-free</li>
        <li>details of the entire supply chain from beginning to end.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Geolocation</h3>
    <p>Geolocation details provided under the EUDR will need to be:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>at least one latitude coordinate and at least one longitude coordinate</li>
        <li>to a minimum of 6 decimal places.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Areas that are larger than 4 hectares need latitude and longitude points that describe the perimeter of the property.
    </p>
    <p>Cattle only need a single geolocation coordinate to describe the establishments where cattle have been kept.</p>
    <p>Geolocation data for all plots is required when a commodity has been produced on more than one plot. This may include
        when a commodity has moved across different plots of land or a product is made of goods from different plots of
        land.</p>
    <p><strong>Failure to provide this information may result in consignments being held at the EU border, returned, or
            destroyed.</strong></p>
    <h2>Country Benchmarking</h2>
    <p>The EUDR will also have a country benchmarking system. This will determine the deforestation and degradation risk of
        each nation.</p>
    <p>Nations will be classed on a 3-tier system, from low-risk to high-risk.</p>
    <p>Definitions for each tier:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>High risk – countries that have been identified as having a high risk of producing relevant goods that do not
            comply with the EUDR.</li>
        <li>Standard risk – countries that do not fall into either the high risk or low risk category.</li>
        <li>Low risk – countries that have been identified as having a low risk of producing relevant goods that do not
            comply with the EUDR.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Classifying risk levels</h3>
    <p>The percentage of consignments inspected at the border on arrival will vary according to the level of risk assigned
        to the country or region of production. The European Commission (EC) is currently assessing each nation’s risk
        profile and will make public all information used to establish risks. This includes the <a

            class="external-link external-link-end"><span>EU Forest Map</span></a>, which provides a general global
        indication of where forest may have been present at 31 December 2020.</p>

            rel="noopener" class="external-link"><span>full list of current assessment criteria</span></a> (Chapter 5).</p>
    <p>The list of country rankings is scheduled for release by 30 December 2024. Until it is released, all nations will be
        ranked as standard risk.</p>
    <h2>EU Forest Map</h2>
    <p>As part of its global forest monitoring, the EU Observatory on deforestation and forest degradation has produced a
        first draft of an advisory global forest map, aimed at representing the state of standing forest cover at 31
        December 2020, based on satellite data and the EU definition of forests. The map is one tool that EU Operators and
        EU Traders may use to determine application of the regulation.</p>
    <p>The map can be accessed here: <a href="https://forest-observatory.ec.europa.eu/forest/gfc2020" target="_blank"

            title="Australia's State of the Forests Report - Past reporting">Australia’s State of Forests Report</a> since
        1998. The <a href="/abares/forestsaustralia/forest-data-maps-and-tools/spatial-data/forest-cover">most recent
            accurate map of Australia’s forests</a>, mapped according to Australia’s internationally recognised forest
        definition, was published in 2023.</p>
    <h2>Applying risk profiles</h2>
    <p>A nation’s risk classification will establish the level of scrutiny by the EU. This includes the proportion of
        consignments inspected by the relevant authorities</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Low-risk countries will be subject to ‘simplified due-diligence’ and a lower proportion of inspections.</li>
        <li>High risk countries will be subject to ‘enhanced scrutiny’ and a higher percentage of inspections.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Australia is still waiting on information from the European Commission on how ‘risk’ will be defined and how border
        controls will be implemented.&nbsp;</p>
